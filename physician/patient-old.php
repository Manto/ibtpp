<div id="content1" class="contentblock">
<span class="emphasis1">Course of Infant Botulism</span><br>
Just as infant botulism has a characteristic presentation, so too the course of the disease has some generally predictable characteristics. Hospitalized patients usually have the acute to subacute onset of symptoms over several days, with progression of weakness that finally necessitates hospital admission. In patients not treated with BabyBIG&reg; whose weakness continues to advance, the nadir is generally reached within 1–2 weeks after admission. Patients may remain at this stage for as long as 2–3 weeks before showing improvement. Once improvement begins, it continues, albeit slowly, over the subsequent weeks. Average hospital stay for untreated patients is approximately 5.5 weeks. In contrast, patients treated with BabyBIG&reg; have an average (mean) hospital stay of approximately 2.5 weeks, and their recovery of strength, tone and movement occurs more quickly.<br><br>
Infant botulism does not usually have a relapsing course, and regression in a patient who has been gradually improving should immediately alert the physician to suspect additional complications or inadequate nutritional or respiratory support (see subsection F below). The patient may be discharged when the patient has shown steady recovery and is able to feed p.o. (or when the parents are comfortable with gavage feeding). Although head-lag and constipation may still be pronounced at this point, the parents may be reassured that these are expected and that over time, full recovery will occur.
</div>
 

<div id="content2" class="contentblock">
<span class="emphasis1">Airway/Respiration</span><br>
The descending paralysis of infant botulism compromises the pharyngeal musculature that maintains the patency of the airway. For this reason, all patients admitted with suspected infant botulism should be placed on a cardiorespiratory monitor and watched carefully for signs of airway obstruction. In addition, a decreased gag reflex combined with dysphagia increases the risk of aspiration. Transcutaneous oxygen (O2) monitoring is desirable. If supplemental inspiratory oxygen (O2) is provided, then transcutaneous carbon dioxide (pCO2) monitoring may provide the single-most sensitive index of clinical deterioration early in the illness. A steadily rising pCO2 signals that the patient may soon need intubation and usually also mechanical ventilation because of weakening respiratory tract musculature.<br><br>
Two simple positioning measures are helpful and recommended for improving the respiratory function of infant botulism patients: 1) a neck support (described below) and 2) a crib which does not bend the mattress to elevate the head of the bed. The crib, illustrated in Figure 3, maintains the patient’s body in one plane while elevating the head at a 30o angle to the feet. Positioning the infant in this way facilitates good chest excursion because gravity pulls the abdominal contents downward. Placing a small cloth roll behind the infant’s neck also helps maintain the normal curvature of the neck, thus promoting airway patency by avoiding neck flexion onto the chest and by preventing pooling of secretions in the pharynx. These positioning measures are urged for all recipients of BabyBIG&reg; as part of standardizing supportive care for study participants.<br><br>
A cloth harness which passes between the legs of the infant and is anchored to the mattress on either side of the patient at waist level may be used to prevent the patient from sliding downward on the bed. Alternatively, a cloth bumper placed below the buttocks may provide the same support.<br><br>
About one-half of all patients with infant botulism, whether or not they are treated with BabyBIG&reg;, will require mechanical ventilatory support (ET tube or respirator) because of inability to protect their airway and/or respiratory insufficiency. Although some infant botulism patients may require prolonged intubation that lasts several weeks, tracheostomy is rarely necessary (less than 1% of California’s over 700 cases have needed one).
</div>
 

<div id="content3" class="contentblock">
<span class="emphasis1">Nutrition</span><br>
Adequate nutrition is of great importance. Although gut motility is slow in these patients, enteral feedings are generally well-tolerated and well-absorbed. (This seems to be due to a relative sparing of the small bowel from the paralytic effects of the botulinum toxin.) In addition, enteral feedings may have the added benefit of helping restore bowel movements. Resumption of defecation is desirable because it helps eliminate botulinum toxin and botulism organisms from the large bowel. Finally, enteral feeding obviates the need for a long-term, in-dwelling intravenous line with its attendant risk of infection.
</div>
 

<div id="content4" class="contentblock">
<span class="emphasis1">Bowel And Bladder Management </span><br>
1. <u>Bowel</u><br>

Botulinum toxin has a profound effect on the large bowel. The constipation that results is generally an early and very persistent symptom. Enteral feeding is the best and most straightforward means of promoting gut motility. The use of cathartics is not recommended, whereas the use of stool softeners like Colace® may be beneficial in tandem with occasional rectal stimulation or glycerin suppository. Infrequently, a small inspissated fecal plug is present in the rectal vault and has to be passed or removed manually before regular defecation can resume.
<br><br>
2. <u>Bladder</u><br>

Bladder atony may be present in infant botulism patients with severe disease (usually ventilator dependent) and increases the risk of urinary tract infection. In patients with urinary retention, gentle manual pressure on the bladder (the Credé method) will usually suffice to empty it. This is best accomplished as a two-person maneuver, in which one person sits the infant up and supports his/her head, while the other person uses two hands (one over the sacrum) to compress the bladder. In-dwelling catheters or frequent intermittent catheterizations are not recommended because of the risk of infection.
</div>
 

<div id="content5" class="contentblock">
<span class="emphasis1">Antibiotics </span><br>
Antibiotics are not efficacious in the treatment of infant botulism. Furthermore, there is concern that administration of antibiotics with clostridiocidal activity may increase the amount of free toxin in the large bowel and actually worsen the patient’s clinical status. Antibiotic use in infant botulism patients is indicated only for the treatment of secondary infections. In these instances, use of a non-clostridiocidal antibiotic, such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim®, Septra®) is preferred. If possible, aminoglycosides should be avoided because they appear to potentiate the action of botulinum toxin at the neuromuscular junction. However, once a patient has been treated with BabyBIG&reg;, any antibiotic may be used to treat a secondary infection because BabyBIG&reg; will neutralize any toxemia that might result from its use.
</div>
 

<div id="content6" class="contentblock">
<span class="emphasis1">If The Patient Isn’t Improving... </span>
As discussed earlier, the pattern of recovery in infant botulism is that of slow, gradual improvement in muscle function. This gradual recovery may be difficult to discern during daily observation. A patient who has made gains and then falters should prompt the physician to reverse premature weaning of respiratory and nutritional support and to seek out possible complications. Infection is the most frequent complication (see Table 2), affecting in descending order of frequency the middle ears, lungs, the urinary tract and the intestinal tract. Bacteremia may also occur from in-dwelling venous lines. Other potential causes of clinical deterioration include anemia, hyponatremia (iatrogenic or akin to inappropriate ADH secretion), pneumothorax and inadvertent intubation of a mainstem bronchus. Medication orders should be reviewed regularly. Sedatives or other drugs which may cause CNS depression as a side effect, such as Reglan®, are relatively contraindicated, and alternatives to their use should be sought when possible.
<br><br>
Finally, it should be asked whether or not the patient is truly deteriorating. The hallmark of infant botulism is fatigability with repetitive muscle activity, so that an infant examined at the end of the day or after sustained activity (a physical therapy session, for example) might appear to have deteriorated. In such instances, reassessing the patient after a rest period may help clarify the situation.

<div id="content8" class="contentblock">
<span class="emphasis1">A Developmental Reminder </span><br>

It is important to remember that botulinum toxin does not appear to cross the blood-brain barrier. Consequently, infant botulism is a disease that does not affect the CNS. Sensation remains intact. Patients are able to hear and to feel normally; thus, staff and family who provide auditory, tactile and even visual stimuli remain important to normal development. Although infant botulism causes a "time-out" period in the motor development of affected patients, parents may be reassured that in uncomplicated cases, a full "catch-up" in motor milestones will occur with time.
</div>

 

<div id="content9" class="contentblock">
<span class="emphasis1">Infection Control Issues </span><br>
Patients with infant botulism excrete both <i>Clostridium botulinum (C. botulinum)</i> toxin and organisms in their stools. Accordingly, diapers from these infants should be bagged and autoclaved. Scrupulous attention to hand washing should be observed by all hospital personnel who have contact with the infant, as much to prevent secondary infections from other pathogens as to prevent transmission of C. botulinum to other patients. Persons with open lesions on their hands should not handle soiled diapers from these patients. Excretion of organisms in feces may continue for as long as three months in infant botulism patients (and even longer in rare instances); hence, close contact between these babies and other infants (e.g., sharing crib and toys) should be avoided while such excretion may be continuing.
</div>

 

<div id="content10" class="contentblock">
<span class="emphasis1">The Parents </span><br>
Infant botulism can be a very frustrating illness for parents---difficult to understand and with daily improvement almost imperceptible. Accordingly, it is important to reassure the parents that in the absence of complications, full and complete recovery is the expected outcome. Some parents find that keeping a daily journal is helpful, so that improvement not apparent from one day to the next may become evident when looking back over a week or more. If the parents wish, the Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program (IBTPP) will provide them with the names and telephone numbers of other parents whose children suffered this disease in order to provide them with peer support both during and after the hospitalization. Please let the IBTPP know promptly if the parents are interested in this service.
