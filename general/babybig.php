BabyBIG<sup>&reg;</sup>, Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (BIG-IV), is an orphan drug that consists of human-derived anti-botulism toxin antibodies that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of infant botulism types A and
B.
<br><br>
The product is a solvent-detergent-treated, sterile, lyophilized powder of immunoglobulin G (IgG), stabilized with 5% sucrose and 1% albumin (human).  It contains no preservative.  The purified immunoglobulin is derived from pooled adult plasma from persons immunized with recombinant botulinum vaccine for serotypes A and B (rBV A/B) who were selected for their high titers of neutralizing antibody against botulinum neurotoxins type A and B.  All donors were tested and found negative for antibodies against the human immunodeficiency virus and the hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses.  The pooled plasma was fractionated by cold ethanol precipitation of the proteins according to the Cohn/Oncley method and modified to yield a product suitable for intravenous administration.
<br><br>
To date, use of BabyBIG<sup>&reg;</sup> to treat more than 2,100 US infant botulism patients has resulted in more than 123 years of avoided hospital stay and more than $153 million of avoided hospital costs.  On average, infant botulism patients have an approximately 3.5 week reduction in time spent in the hospital, resulting in over $97,000 in avoided hospital costs (when compared to the pivotal clinical trial placebo group).
