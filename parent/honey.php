Honey is the one identified and avoidable food reservoir of <i>C. botulinum</i>, the
bacterial spore that causes infant botulism. While most cases of infant botulism
today are not caused by exposure to honey prior to illness, it is the only
avoidable source of exposure to the bacterium that has been linked to infant
botulism cases by both laboratory and epidemiologic evidence (See Prevention
page). By a process of exclusion (testing over the years of hundreds of foods,
beverages, and other items placed in infants' mouths with negative results), it
was concluded that most infant botulism patients acquired their spores by
swallowing microscopic dust particles on which the spores travel.

The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) prepared an informative brochure to increase awareness of avoiding feeding honey to infants under one year of age.  The pamphlet is not copyrighted and CDPH encourages any and all interested parties to download, print, and distribute this brochure.

Please refer to the American Academy of Pediatrics best practice guidelines regarding feeding
solids to infants (<a href="http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition" target="_blank">click here</a>).
<br /><br />
Although honey is a known food vehicle for the bacteria that causes infant botulism, we typically don’t consider an individual honey exposure to be overly risky for acquiring the bacteria that causes infant botulism. Honey is the one dietary reservoir of C. botulinum spores thus far definitively linked to infant botulism by both laboratory and epidemiologic evidence.  However, that said, not every jar of honey has botulinum spores in it.  To date, avoiding feeding honey to infants 12 months of age or less is the only known prevention measure for infant botulism.

If, in the next few weeks you believe your infant is exhibiting the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/hcp/clinical-overview/infant-botulism.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/infant-botulism.html">signs and symptoms of infant botulism</a>, please reach out to your pediatrician.
